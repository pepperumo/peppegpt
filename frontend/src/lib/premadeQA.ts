   - Focused on improving structural efficiency while minimizing material usage
   - Makes advanced optimization techniques accessible and cost-effective

2. **At IMI Climate Control:**
   - Developed data-driven testing platforms for heating and hydronic systems
   - Combined sensor data analysis with FEM validation (ANSYS)
   - Applied statistical modeling to identify design/performance issues
   - Implemented analytics-informed design iterations with CAD prototypes

3. **Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing:**
   - AI-driven quality control for industrial applications
   - Automated defect detection faster and more accurately than human inspection

**The Advantage:**
This combination allows Giuseppe to:
- Understand the physical constraints and engineering requirements
- Apply AI/ML optimally to engineering problems
- Validate AI solutions with proven engineering methods
- Bridge communication between engineering and data science teams

This interdisciplinary approach is increasingly valuable as industries embrace digital transformation and AI-driven design.`,
